**CPP00**
The biggest challenge in this module was to built a simple phonebook software mimicking the technology of the 80s. I've learned about classes, member functions, and basic C++ concepts such as namespaces, initialization lists, and more. By implementing the PhoneBook and Contact classes, I've gained hands-on experience in class design, encapsulation, and managing data in arrays.

**CPP01** introduced me to memory allocation strategies in C++, particularly the stack and heap.

**CPP02**
The most interesting assignment was BSP where I've applied geometric algorithms, showcasing practical applications of class design and object-oriented programming.

**CPP03**
The module introduces the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in C++ through the creation of the ClapTrap class and its derived class, DiamondTrap, FragTrap and ScavTrap. The task aims to simulate the characteristics of a robot in a gaming environment, where different types of traps possess unique attributes and behaviors.

**CPP04** extends the exploration of inheritance and polymorphism by introducing the Animal base class and its derived classes: Dog and Cat. These classes represent different types of animals, each with its own unique characteristics and behaviors.
