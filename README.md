**CPP00**
The biggest challenge in this module was to built a simple phonebook software mimicking the technology of the 80s. I've learned about classes, member functions, and basic C++ concepts such as namespaces, initialization lists, and more. By implementing the PhoneBook and Contact classes, I've gained hands-on experience in class design, encapsulation, and managing data in arrays.

**CPP01** introduced me to memory allocation strategies in C++, particularly the stack and heap.

**CPP02**
The most interesting assignment was BSP where I've applied geometric algorithms, showcasing practical applications of class design and object-oriented programming.

**CPP03**
The module introduces the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in C++ through the creation of the ClapTrap class and its derived class, DiamondTrap, FragTrap and ScavTrap. The task aims to simulate the characteristics of a robot in a gaming environment, where different types of traps possess unique attributes and behaviors.

**CPP04** extends the exploration of inheritance and polymorphism by introducing the Animal base class and its derived classes: Dog and Cat. These classes represent different types of animals, each with its own unique characteristics and behaviors.

**CPP05**
I gained a deeper understanding of abstract base classes (like AForm) and how concrete classes (such as ShrubberyCreationForm, RobotomyRequestForm, and PresidentialPardonForm) inherit from them, implementing specific functionalities. I learned how to handle exceptions using custom exceptions (GradeTooHighException, GradeTooLowException) 

**CPP06**
I learned how to convert a string literal into various scalar types (char, int, float, double) and handle edge cases like NaN or infinity.  I worked with raw memory addresses, converting pointers to uintptr_t and back, which taught me how to manipulate memory safely. I learned the importance of virtual destructors in polymorphic classes and how to use inheritance and polymorphism to identify object types at runtime without typeinfo.

**CPP07**
In this assignment, I implemented function templates for swap, min, and max to work with any type that supports comparison operators. 

**CPP08**
I worked with C++ templates and advanced container manipulation. I implemented a function template easyfind that searches for the first occurrence of an integer in a container, throwing an exception or returning an error if not found. I also developed a Span class that stores a maximum of N integers, with functions for adding numbers and calculating the shortest and longest spans between the stored numbers. Furthermore, I created a MutantStack class, which extends std::stack to make it iterable by adding iterators.
